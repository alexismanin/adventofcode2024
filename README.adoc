= Advent of Code 2024

My personal attempt to solve https://adventofcode.com/2024[Advent Of Code 2024] using Kotlin.

To run a specific part of any given day, run:

[source, shell]
----
./gradlew run --args="$DAY_NUMBER PART_NUMBER"
----

Example: to run the second part of the first day, run `./gradlew run --args="1 2"`

== Add a new day

. Add a `DayXX.kt` file in link:src/main/kotlin/[] directory.
. Set its package to `fr.amanin.aoc2024.dayXX`
. Implement a `fun partX(inputLines: List<String>) : Any` for each part X of the challenge of the day

=== Testing

There is a test class in link:src/test/kotlin/TestDays.kt[] file.
This is a parameterized test that accept CSV source arguments:

. day number
. part number
. test result

The input text file for the day test must be named `DayXX.txt`, and be set in link:src/test/resources/[] directory.
